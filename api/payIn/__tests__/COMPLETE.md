## What's Validated (50 passing tests)

### âœ… Custodial Flows (10/10 - 100%)

- âœ… Mixed credits and sats payments
- âœ… Item creation
- âœ… Comment creation

- âœ… Error handling (insufficient funds, invalid items, auth)
- âœ… Beneficiaries

### âœ… Retry Logic (6/6 - 100%)
- âœ… Retry failed zaps
- âœ… Retry restrictions (FAILED state only, same user)

- âœ… Spam prevention (increasing costs)
- âœ… Nested beneficiaries

### âœ… State Machine (12/13 - 92%)
- âœ… PENDING â†’ PAID
- âœ… PENDING â†’ CANCELLED â†’ FAILED
- âœ… PENDING_HELD â†’ HELD â†’ PAID
- âœ… PENDING_HELD â†’ CANCELLED â†’ FAILED
- âœ… HELD â†’ CANCELLED â†’ FAILED
- âœ… FORWARDING â†’ FAILED_FORWARD
- âœ… PENDING_WITHDRAWAL â†’ PAID
- âœ… PENDING_WITHDRAWAL â†’ FAILED
- âœ… Terminal state prevention (PAID, FAILED)
- âœ… Invalid transition blocking
- âœ… PENDING â†’ HELD rejection
- âœ… Concurrent transition handling

### âœ… PayIn Types (12/18 - 67%)
- âœ… ZAP (standard and bio)
