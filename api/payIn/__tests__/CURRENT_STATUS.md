## Run Command

```bash
./api/payIn/__tests__/test
```

## Next Steps

The remaining 33 failing tests are due to:
1. Anonymous/pessimistic flows need invoice creation mocks
2. State transitions need boss passed correctly
3. Some edge cases need proper test data

**Note:** I've fixed what I can without modifying application code. Some tests may require application code changes to work properly (the BigInt issues we found).
