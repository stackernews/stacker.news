Stacker News now provides daily summary notifications of your stacking and spending activity!

## What's included?

At the start of each day, you'll receive a notification showing:

- How many sats you stacked the previous day
- How many sats you spent the previous day 
- Your net gain or loss for the day

This helps you keep track of your activity on the platform and understand your daily stacking patterns.

2. Under the "notify me when..." section
3. Check or uncheck "I receive daily summary of sats stacked and spent"

The notifications are enabled by default for all users.

Notifications are sent automatically at approximately 1:15 AM Central Time each day, summarizing the previous day's activity.

## Privacy

Like all notifications, daily stacked summaries are private and only visible to you.
